    <h1 id="header">Common Settings for HKSC Races</h1>
    <div id="body">
    <p>If you're starting out with randomizer, you're encouraged to experiment with settings and play with what you like best. However, if you're interested in racing in the speedrunning community discord server, it's useful to know what settings are standard for races. It's important to note that the settings  vary from format to format, and change over time as new things are added to the randomizer.</p>
    <p>Lifetotems preset is a given for all HKSC races. Solo formats also turn on maps, junk pit chests, and static journal entries, and team formats such as 2v2 Blackout also turn on boss essence in addition to those. Lore tablets are turned on sometimes for both solo and team formats. Grubs will be synced in the case of team formats (ie in their own pool, sometimes with mimics) but the sync vanilla items setting in Itemsync is banned, and we don't sync simple key usages. Skip settings are almost always none. Two shards per mask is usually turned on, especially if other connections are on. Random start location. Dupe settings are usually the default for races in the interest of fairness. Sometimes, we may turn off dupe claw for solo formats.</p>
    <p>If Rando Plus is used, the settings are usually Nail Upgrades and 2 dupe pale ore, or sometimes dupe spore shroom if lore tablets are randomized. If More Locations is used, the settings toggled on are typically Stag Nest Egg and Baldur Shell Chest. ReopenCityDoor may be set to "unlockable", particularly for solo formats. Scatternest is used for team races, and almost always excludes Crystallized Mound start due to the high probability of a player getting stuck. Other connections may be turned on, but this is usually decided per-race.</p>
    <p>If a <a href="/rando/tourney">rando tournament</a> is ongoing, races are likely to use the default settings for that tournament.</p>

    <h2>Lever GTTOS Settings</h2>
    <p>If you spend a lot of time in the rando racing community, you might notice people pinging for something called "lever GTTOS". <a href="/rando/formats">GTTOS</a> itself is a popular format in the randomizer community. Most of the time when people say "Lever GTTOS", they are referring to a specific set of settings, one of which is levers. Sort of like how "french toast" implies a very specific way of cooking and consuming the toast, rather than it just being any toast that is also french.</p>
    <p>The following settings are part of "Lever GTTOS":</p>
    <div class="list">
      <p>Lifetotems plus Maps, Journal Entries, Junk Pit Chests, and Lore Tablets.</p>
      <p>No required skips</p>
      <p>Random start location</p>
      <p>Start with a random charm</p>
      <p>Two shards per mask</p>
      <p>Longer progression chains</p>
      <p>Custom progression depth settings: multi location penalty and dupe item penalty on, location priority transform type: quadratic, item location priority interaction: cliff, and coefficient 0.3</p>
      <p>Dupe item settings: Crystal heart, mothwing cloak, dream nail, void heart, level one spells, two extra keys in logic. Turning dupe vertical off is essential!</p>
      <p>Custom Constraint Injector connection settings: Late vertical, early dash, and sensible shops (makes cost items less likely to appear in shops, such as reducing the chance that Iselda or Sly will be selling Geo).</p>
      <p>Custom Group Injector: Quill always placed at Dirtmouth Stag.</p>
      <p>Custom Pool Injector: Extras (adds a dupe shaman stone, dupe dashmaster, and four extra Monomons to the pool.)</p>
      <p>Rando Plus settings: Dupe spore shroom</p>
      <p>Reopen City Door: Unlockable</p>
      <p>More Locations: Stag Nest egg, Baldur Shell chest</p>
      <p>And of course, Lever Rando should be on!</p>
    </div>
