    <h1>Common Formats for Racing Rando</h1>
    <h3>Lockout</h3>
    <p>A 1v1 format where the first to 13 goals (A majority of the board) wins. Marking a goal prevents your opponent from marking it. You may strategically hold off marking goals, but this risks you losing the goal.</p>
    <p><em>Time estimate: 1-2 hours</em></p>
    <h3>Blackout</h3>
    <p>Usually done in 2v..v2s. The first team to mark every goal on the board and have every member kill Radiance wins. Only one person in a team needs to complete a goal for the team to mark it.</p>
    <p><em>Time estimate: 1:30-3 hours</em></p>
    <h3>3 Lines</h3>
    <p>1v..v1 format. First person to mark 3 lines of goals wins. Lines may be rows, columns or diagonals.</p>
    <p><em>Time estimate: ~1 hour</em></p>
    <h3>Chaos Lockout</h3>
    <p>1v..v1 format. Lockout except you are only locked out once (total number of players / 2) have marked a goal (rounded up). First to 13 wins.</p>
    <p><em>Time estimate: 1-2 hours</em></p>
    <h3>Invasion</h3>
    <p>1v1 lockout format. See <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2WPnvHQ.jpg">here</a></p>
    <p><em>Time estimate: 1-2 hours</em></p>
    <h3>Time Attack</h3>
    <p>A 1v...v1 time-restricted format where players compete to see who can complete the most goals in a set period of time. Each goal is worth one point and each row/column is worth an additional two. </p>
    <p><em>Time Limit: 45 minutes to 1 hour.</em></p>
    <h3>Battleship</h3>
    <p>1v1 format. Secretly place 3 different battleships on the card beforehand (Diagonals allowed), 2 goals in a row, 3 goals in a row and 4 goals in a row. Then whenever your opponent completes a goal, tell them if it hit or missed your
      battleships.
      Winner has to sink their opponent's battleships. </p>
    <h3>Exploration</h3>
    <p>The board begins mostly hidden, with only a few goals visible to the players. When a player marks a goal, the adjacant goals become visible. Commonly played to 2, 3, or 4 corners, starting from the center. Can be played either solo or 2v...v2.
    </p>
    <h3>"Get to the other side"</h3>
    <p>Uses a variation on the exploration board generator. Players start with all of the goals on the left visible, and must mark a goal in the farthest right column.</p>
    <h3>Roguelike</h3>
    <p>Uses the roguelike option on the exploration board generator. Players must make it from one side of the board to the other. Marking a goal will reveal the closest goals in the next column, but be careful! You can only mark 1 goal per column,
      which means you're stuck with whatever you revealed, so choose wisely. Usually played as a 1v...v1 format.</p>
