    <h1>Common Formats for Racing Rando</h1>
    <h3>Lockout</h3>
    <p>A 1v1 format where the first to 13 goals (A majority of the board) wins. Marking a goal prevents your opponent from marking it. You may strategically hold off marking goals, but this risks you losing the goal.</p>
    <p><em>Time estimate: 1-2 hours</em></p>
    <h3>Blackout</h3>
    <p>Usually done in 2v..v2s. The first team to mark every goal on the board and have every member kill Radiance wins. Only one person in a team needs to complete a goal for the team to mark it.</p>
    <p><em>Time estimate: 1:30-3 hours</em></p>
    <h3>All Majors</h3>
    <p>Semi-spoiler format. Essentially a 2v2 "All Skills" TE rando race, except the pool of skills also includes dupes and arbitrary charms (sometimes). Using the MajorItemsByAreaTracker mod, teams race to get the counter of items remaining down to 0 and finish the game with Radiance. </p>
    <p><em>Time estimate: 1-2 hours</em></p>
    <h3>3 Lines</h3>
    <p>1v..v1 format. First person to mark 3 lines of goals wins. Lines may be rows, columns or diagonals.</p>
    <p><em>Time estimate: ~1 hour</em></p>
    <h3>Chaos Lockout</h3>
    <p>1v..v1 format. Lockout except you are only locked out once (total number of players / 2) have marked a goal (rounded up). First to 13 wins.</p>
    <p><em>Time estimate: 1-2 hours</em></p>
    <h3>Invasion</h3>
    <p>1v1 lockout format. See <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2WPnvHQ.jpg">here</a></p>
    <p><em>Time estimate: 1-2 hours</em></p>
    <h3>Time Attack</h3>
    <p>A 1v...v1 time-restricted format where players compete to see who can complete the most goals in a set period of time. Each goal is worth one point and each row/column is worth an additional two. </p>
    <p><em>Time Limit: 45 minutes to 1 hour.</em></p>
    <h3>Battleship</h3>
    <p>1v1 format. Secretly place 3 different battleships on the card beforehand (Diagonals allowed), 2 goals in a row, 3 goals in a row and 4 goals in a row. Then whenever your opponent completes a goal, tell them if it hit or missed your
      battleships.
      Winner has to sink their opponent's battleships. </p>
    <h3>Exploration</h3>
    <p>The board begins mostly hidden, with only a few goals visible to the players. When a player marks a goal, the adjacant goals become visible. Commonly played to 2, 3, or 4 corners, starting from the center. Can be played either solo or 2v...v2.
    </p>
    <h3>"Get to the other side"</h3>
    <p>Uses a variation on the exploration board generator. Players start with all of the goals on the left visible, and must mark a goal in the farthest right column.</p>
    <h3>Roguelike</h3>
    <p>Uses the roguelike option on the exploration board generator. Players must make it from one side of the board to the other. Marking a goal will reveal the closest goals in the next column, but be careful! You can only mark 1 goal per column,
      which means you're stuck with whatever you revealed, so choose wisely. Usually played as a 1v...v1 format.</p>
