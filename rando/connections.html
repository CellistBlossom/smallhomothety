  <p>Randomizer connections expand on the randomizer 4 mod, doing anything from randomizing a few new locations to adding new charms and areas. These can be installed with your mod installer of choice and then toggled on in-game in the "connections" menu. See the <a href="/rando/mods">mods</a> page for instructions for setting up mods.</p>
  <p>Modders are cooking up new things all the time, so this list might not always include every connection. As you can see, there are a lot!</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/nerthul11/AccessRandomizer">Access Randomizer</a></strong> Randomizes access to several locations, such as adding unique keys for simple key locations and randomizing each chain in the Black Egg Temple.</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/homothetyhk/BenchRando/">Bench Rando</a></strong> Randomizes benches in various ways, such as placing them as pickups similar to how stag stations work in regular rando.

      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/dplochcoder/HollowKnight.KnightOfNights">Knight of Knights</a></strong> A connection created for the <a href="/events/holloween2025">Holloween</a> plando, which can also be used in normal randos. <span><a class="menulink menu-inline" onclick="return toggleMenu2('menu2')">Plando spoiler (click to show)</a><span class="menu" id="menu2"> Adds a new ability called "Reveksong" to the randomization pool, which allows the player to summon Revek wherever they want.

      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/dplochcoder/HollowKnight.ScatteredAndLost">Scattered and Lost</a></strong> Created for the <a href="/events/hk8y/randoday">HK8Y</a> plando but can be used in normal randos as well. <span><a class="menulink menu-inline" onclick="return toggleMenu2('menu3')">Plando spoiler (click to show)</a><span class="menu" id="menu3"> Adds a celeste-inspired custom map in Bretta's house. Optionally the level can be blocked off by gates that require randomized "hearts" to unlock. The soul totems inside the custom level can be randomized as well.</span></span></p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/flibber-hk/HollowKnight.Scatternest/">Scatternest</a></strong> An add-on for ItemSync that allows you to have multiple different spawn locations, causing co-op players to not spawn in the same location. If you play co-op Itemsync a lot, this mod is for you.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/flibber-hk/HollowKnight.SkillUpgrades/">Skill Upgrades</a></strong> Randomizes some upgrades for the Knight's skills, such as the ability to dash multiple times in the air or dive horizontally.</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/BadMagic100/TheRealJournalRando/">The Real Journal Rando</a></strong> This mod can randomize all journal entries not included in the base randomizer 4 settings, with various options to tweak which entries are included. Hunters Notes can also be randomized.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/flibber-hk/HollowKnight.TrandoPlus/">Trando Plus</a></strong> Adds some additional transition rando options, such as randomizing only door transitions.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/dpinela/Transcendence/">Transcendence</a></strong> Adds 15 more charms to the randomization pool with some fun new abilities.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/dplochcoder/HollowKnight.TreasureHunt">TreasureHunt</a></strong> A tracker for your rando that allows you to play the semi-spoiler format Treasure Hunt, in which you are given a list of the exact locations of major items and must collect all of them. Configurable to change what is a "major item" and how many locations are revealed at once.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/dplochcoder/HollowKnight.UnRando">UnRando</a></strong> Fixes the order of items obtained so that two players playing the same seed will always obtain the same items in the same order, regardless of what locations they checked. Rarely used outside of randomizer races.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/TheMathGeek314/VendorRando/">Vendor Rando</a></strong> Randomizes the locations of shopkeepers so that they can appear at any* randomized location.</p>
      <p><em style="font-size:small; color:darkslategrey">* Terms and conditions may apply.</em></p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/TheMathGeek314/YetAnotherRandoConnection/">Yet Another Rando Connection</a></strong> Yet another connection that adds settings. Like soul jars and vines, if you are normal, or jelly egg bombs and Oro's scarecrow if you like your randos more on the unhinged side.</p>

    <h2>Custom Injector Mods</h2>
    <p>These mods do nothing on their own but can be used to customize the randomization on a deeper level than the base randomizer mod allows.</p>
    <p>If you want to make packs for these yourself, be sure to read their READMEs for detailed instructions. Alternatively, the randomizer connections channel in the speedrunning <a href="https://discord.gg/3JtHPsBjHD">Discord</a> has a "Custom Injector packs" thread where many people have shared theirs.</p>
    <div class="list">
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/homothetyhk/CustomConstraintInjector/">Custom Constraint Injector</a></strong> Can be used to define which items can be placed at which locations.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/homothetyhk/CustomGroupInjector/">Custom Group Injector</a></strong> Can be used to add new groups to the randomizer, similar to the base randomizer 4 Split Group Randomizer but with more customization.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/homothetyhk/CustomLogicInjector/">Custom Logic Injector</a></strong> Can be used to customize the logic for items and locations (i.e., what items and skip settings the player needs to have for a given check to be considered obtainable).</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/homothetyhk/CustomPoolInjector/">Custom Pool Injector</a></strong> Can be used to customize which items are considered to be pooled together so that they can be toggled on or off at the same time.</p>
