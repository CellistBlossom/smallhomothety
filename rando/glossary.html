  <p>The Randomizer community has words and abbreviations that are used to refer to different aspects of the game. While knowing these terms is not necessary to play the game, they exist to quickly communicate with other players on the fly,
    especially in racing situations. You may also hear comms use these terms in tournaments and events, since most comms are experienced rando racers.</p>
  <p>The list here is not comprehensive, and may change as the community changes and new things are added to the randomizer. If you notice I forgot something, please submit it to the <a
      href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_2Q48iSjXe3zLVCr2SroyP0pnLlX-qIKs3tHNklYBy1ldDw/viewform">suggestion box</a>! </p>
  <p>For terms that are more specific to the speedrunning side of the community, but still may be used in rando, see this <a href="https://pastebin.com/015s8nuk">pastebin</a>. </p>
  <h2 id="generalrandoterms">General Randomizer Terms</h2>
  <div class="list-container">
    <div class="list">
      <p><strong>Baby Seed</strong>: A term used to describe a seed with a lot of easy early movement and progression</p>
      <p><strong>Burger King (BK)</strong>: In Itemsync, Multiworld, and Archipelago randomizers, being unable to obtain any checks without receiving progression from another player.</p>
      <p><strong>Check</strong>: Location containing a randomized item.</p>
      <p><strong>Go-mode</strong>: Being able to finish the goal of the seed/format without obtaining any additional items. Usually, this means that you are hard-rushing your finish and not doing checks on the way. Also known as being “in go”.</p>
      <p><strong>Hash</strong>: The sequence of four enemies listed after randomization used to ensure that racers have the same settings and seed.</p>
      <p><strong>Helper Log</strong>: Located in your save files folder after generating a rando seed. Shows what item locations are in logic and any items that have been previewed. </p>
      <p><strong>Intended Progression</strong>: The order that the randomizer expects you to obtain items; see progression. </p>
      <p><strong>Logic</strong>: Whether or not the randomizer believes you can reach a location (a location is “in logic” or “out of logic”); alternatively, a synonym of intended progression. </p>
      <p><strong>Modlog (noun)</strong>: A log located in your save files folder, used for diagnosing and troubleshooting errors; also see <em>modlogging</em>. </p>
      <p><strong>"Modlogging" (verb)</strong>: A form of cheating by reading the spoiler log in non-spoiler formats. Almost always used hyperbolically. Originally, spoiler log did not exist and the locations of items were written to the modlog. The
        term originated from previous randomizer versions, and is still in use, even though the modlog no longer contains spoilers. <em>“How did you finish so fast?”</em> <em>“Well, dash was super cursed, but I literally modlogged it, so…”</em></p>
      <p><strong>Orphan (a check)</strong>: Clearing all the checks in the area around a check, leaving the check isolated, usually due to not having movement to do the check; generally avoided because going back for the orphaned check loses a lot of
        time. Also known as "stranding" the check.</p>
      <p><strong>Progression</strong>: Any item that allows one to reach a previously unreachable location. </p>
      <p><strong>Random Obtain</strong>: A random item, usually as required for a bingo board, such as a specific key or charm, or a number of minor items such as rancid eggs. Movement and duped major items are usually not referred to as “random
        obtains”. </p>
      <p><strong>Seed</strong>: The number used to generate random placements; or, the settings of the current randomizer; or, the current randomizer as a whole. </p>
      <p><strong>Sequence Break</strong>: Reaching a location that the randomizer does not expect you to be able to reach, usually via a skip; also known as “breaking logic”. </p>
      <p><strong>Spoiler Log</strong>: Located in your save files folder after generating a rando seed. Contains the locations of every item in the randomizer seed. Banned for use in most randomizer races, except for formats that specifically allow
        it; these formats are referred to as “spoiler formats”. </p>
      <p><strong>Tracker Log</strong>: Located in your save files folder after generating a rando seed. Shows what items have been picked up in the order that they were obtained. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="mods">Mods</h2>
  <div class="list-container">
    <div class="list">
      <p><strong>Itemsync</strong>: A mod that sends items obtained by one player to all other players in their “room”, as well as removing them from those players’ games. </p>
      <p><strong>Lumafly</strong>: A mod installer that provides easy access to most published mods, including all required mods for rando and add-ons; formerly known as "Scarab+". </p>
      <p><strong>Scarab</strong>: Another popular mod installer with slightly fewer features, but the same list of mods.</p>
