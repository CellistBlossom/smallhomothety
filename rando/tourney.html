  <p>Because many people invest time in randomizer racing, the Hollow Knight Speedrunning Community occasionally hosts tournaments for racers to prove their prowess! These tournaments are usually organized in the discord server and restreamed on our
    <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hollowknightcommunity">community Twitch channel</a> (though this hasn't always been the case).</p>
  <p>Tournament races are considered to be more competitive than non-tournament races. They generally consist of only one format and may have tournament-specific rules. Tournaments, if restreamed, are almost always streamed live.</p>
  <p>For an explanation of individual formats that may be used in tournaments, see the <a href="formats">formats</a> page.</p>

        <p>This tournament is a one-day tournament taking place on March 21st, 2026, beginning at 6:00pm UTC/1:00pm EST. The tournament will consist of three rounds: a qualifier, a top cut round, and a final round. The first 40% (subject to change) teams from the first round will move on to the second, and only the top two teams from the second round will play in the finals.</p>
        <p>The tournament is played 2v2, but there's a catch: runners are not allowed to use the Itemsync mod to sync progression between them and their teammate! That means that they'll need to constantly communicate where important items are and do some creative routing to make sure that they get what they need. The first team to black out the bingo board and have both players finish with Radiance wins the match.</p>
        <p>Per round, all teams will play on the same seed. Additionally, all rounds will use the same base settings, but for the finals the teams are allowed to pick a maximum of two "gimmicks" to add to the settings. The possible gimmicks are:</p>
    <div class="list">
        <p>Ghost Essence + Dream trees</p>
        <p>The Real Journal Rando (entries only) + Boss Essence (Excluding GPZ and White Defender)</p>
        <p>Bench rando (locations only, minimum of 2 in each area)</p>
        <p>Remove dupe items except for dash and claw</p>
        <p>“Advanced”  skips turned on</p>
        <p>Nail upgrades + 2 Dupe Pale ore</p>
        <p>Skill Upgrades + Transcendence mods (Bluemothwings banned)</p>

  <h2 id="allmajors-may2025">2025 All Majors Tournament</h2>
      <p>This tournament was a one-day tournament that took place on May 10th, 2025. The tournament consisted of three rounds: a qualifier, semi-final, and final round. Each round consisted of all of the remaining teams playing the same seed concurrently, with the top finishing teams moving onto the next round. The first 6 teams to finish in the qualifiers moved onto the semi-finals, and the top two teams to finish in the semi-finals moved on to the final round.</p>
      <p>All Majors is a semi-spoiler format. Each team has a counter of major items remaining in each area, but they don't know what the items are or their exact locations. Their goal is to find all of these major items and finish with both players defeating the Radiance! In this tournament, the items considered "major items" are:</p>
      <div class="list">
        <p>Mothwing Cloak (x2), Shade Cloak (x2), Mantis Claw, Crystal Heart, Monarch Wings (x2), Isma's Tear, Swim</p>
        <p>Dream Nail (x2), Dreamgate, Awoken Dream Nail, Lurien, Monomon, Herrah, White Fragment, Kingsoul, Void Heart</p>
        <p>Vengeful Spirit (x2), Shade Soul, Desolate Dive (x2), Descending Dark, Howling Wraiths (x2), Abyss Shriek</p>
        <p>Dash Slash, Cyclone Slash, Great Slash</p>
        <p>King's Brand, Lumafly Lantern, Tram Pass, Elevator Pass, City Crest</p>
        <p>Shopkeeper's Key, Elegant Key, Love Key, Grimmchild, Defender's Crest, Spore Shroom</p>
        <p>Fragile Heart, Fragile Greed, Fragile Strength, Unbreakable Heart, Unbreakable Greed, Unbreakable Strength</p>
    </div>
      <h3>Gimmicks</h3>
      <p>"Gimmicks" are extra settings added to the base tourney settings to spice up the match. This tournament was played without gimmicks for the first two rounds, while the final round was required to have two gimmicks. To select gimmicks, both teams were required to offer the other a list of three gimmicks, and one would selected from the list by the opposing team. A list of gimmicks for this tournament can be found below:</p>
          <div class="list">
            <p>Ghosts + Dream Trees</p>

            <p>BenchRando (Locations only)</p>

  <h2 id="blackout2024">2024 Blackout TE Tournament</h2>
        <p>The BOTE 2024 tournament ran from June 15th, 2024 to October 11th, 2024. The tournament format began with a group stage, where the 25 teams were sorted into 5 groups of 5, and each team played each of the other teams in their own group twice. The 8 top teams advanced to a double-elimination bracket based on a combination of wins and tiebreaker points scored.</p>
        <p>Tiebreaker points are calculated by taking the sum of a team's opponent's scores in matches that the team won, and subtracting it from the sum of the tiebreaker points the team gained in matches that they lost. Per match, a team can gain or lose 31 tiebreaker points: 25 for the losing team's score on the bingo board, and 6 for the losing team's progress towards TE (3 white fragments and 3 dreamers).</p>
        <p>Like the previous 2023 All Majors Tournament, this tournament allowed gimmicks! Gimmicks are settings that are added to the randomized pool beyond the default settings to help spice up each match. Both teams offered the other team a list of three potential gimmicks, and one would be picked from each list. Gimmicks were optional for the first round, but every round in the rest of the tournament were required to have a minimum of two gimmicks.</p>
        <p>The list of gimmicks that were allowed for the 2024 Blackout TE tournament bracket stage are:</p>
        <div class="list">
          <p>Gimmicks that randomize additional checks: Grimmkin Flames, Whispering Roots + Ghost essence, Lore Tablets + Mr Mushroom, Randomized Focus</p>
          <p>Settings that alter logic with skips: These have been condensed into a single gimmick including Precise Movement, Background and Enemy Pogos, Infection Skips, and No Swim/No Tear!</p>
          <p>Settings that alter how rando functions: Lemm/Junk Shops, replace the top left goal of the board with Complete Colosseum 3</p>
          <p>Gimmicks voted upon by rando community: Replace the middle goal of the board with "obtain 46 grubs"; Map-Area randomizer; Access Randomizer (chains + unique keys + respect), Split Claw, Randomized Levers, More Doors (all doors, no keys), the Real Journal Rando (no notes, no bonus entries), Cursed Nail.</p>

  <h2 id="allmajors2023">2023 All Majors Tournament</h2>
      <p>The tournament was a 2v2 All Major Items TE double-elimination tournament. All matches were best of 1s until the end of the tournament. Winner's and Loser's finals were best of 3s, and Grand Finals was a best of 5 with a one-game advantage to the team in the upper bracket.</p>
      <p>All Majors is a semi-spoiler format. For more information, see the <a href="/rando/formats">formats</a> page. For this tournament, the items that were required to be obtained are:</p>
        <div class="list">
            <p>Mothwing Cloak (x2), Shade Cloak, Mantis Claw, Crystal Heart, Monarch Wings (x2), Isma's Tear, Swim</p>

        </div>
      <h3>Gimmicks</h3>
      <p>"Gimmicks" in this tournament were items that were added to the randomized pool beyond the default settings to help spice up each match. The first match was played without gimmicks; however, starting with winner's round 2 and loser's
        round 2, players were required to add at least one gimmick to the settings.</p>
        <p>To select gimmicks, the team with the higher seed would propose a list of three gimmicks and the team with the lower seed would be required to pick one. They would repeat the process with the lower seed proposing gimmicks and the higher seed picking, and the match would be played with those two gimmicks. Teams were also allowed to propose a third (or more) gimmick, but both teams would need to agree and may need permission from the TOs for gimmicks not on the list of preapproved ones. A list of gimmicks can be found below:</p>
          <div class="list">
              <p>Gimmicks that randomize additional checks: Grimmkin Flames, Whispering Roots, Lore Tablets, Randomized Focus</p>
              <p>Settings that alter logic with skips: Precise Movement, Background and Enemy Pogos, Infection Skips, No Swim/No Tear</p>
              <p>Settings that alter how rando functions: Ghost Essence, Lemm/Junk Shops, Colo3 (the Glory of Being a Fool mod)</p>
              <p>Gimmicks voted upon by rando community: Map Area transition rando, 3 Masks + 2 Charm notches, Split Claw, Fragile Charms being major items</p>
