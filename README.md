## How to Run
This website serves static HTML that is deployed via Github Pages.

To run locally, clone the repository and run a local server of your choice.

Note: Github Pages supports removing the file extensions and exact path inside HTML files. To fix this locally, update any broken links with a backslash at the beginning, or just provide an exact path. For example:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css">
```
becomes
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/stylesheet.css">
```
