    <p>The amount of things to learn as a new glitched runner can seem intimidating, so I've compiled a list of categories as recommendations for where to start! You should also check out my <a href="/rando">playlist of glitch tutorials</a> if you
      need help, and my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7dXvvR7OhcqaC3sdHvuqrxwdIjiZ0Ava">playlist of meme runs</a> for routes, and don't forget to join the <a href="https://discord.gg/3JtHPsBjHD">Discord </a>if you haven't already.
    </p>
    <p>Note that while I recommend that you run these on current patch, and have made this guide with that in mind, there are lots of good 1028 categories to try! I won't cover them here, but you can ask in the Discord about anything you want to know
      about.</p>

    <h2 id="short-categories">Short Categories (Baby's first)</h2>
    <p>These are short categories, 0-5 minutes in length. These are especially good for learning noclip categories. If you like ILs, you might like running these, since they're similar in length.</p>
    <div class="list">
    <p><strong>Pure Snail</strong> 💨🐈🍝 Take damage, and then heal with Quick Focus, Spore Shroom, Baldur Shell, and Shape of Unn equipped. Silly category that takes around 30 seconds and is mostly loads. Very good for practicing super early
      control, but is mostly a joke.</p>
    <p><strong>Al2ba%</strong> ☁💨🐈🍝 Kill both the Greenpath and QG alubas. A very short GMMS category that starts out in yesclip and ends with dgate noclip. Very short in length, around 2 and a half minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Great Hopper%</strong> ☁🐈🍝 Kill a Great Hopper. GMMS category that remains in noclip the entire run. It kills the upper edge hopper (aka "Adam") and takes around 2min.</p>
    <p><strong>A1uba%</strong> 💨🐈🍝 Kill an Aluba. Kills the Greenpath aluba specifically. GMMS yesclip category that's mostly NMG movement, but a lot of fun. Around 1-2mins. </p>
    <p><strong>Elderbug%</strong> 💨🐈🍝 Deliver the delicate flower to Elderbug. GMMS category that stays in yesclip for the entire run. Good for learning the basics of MMS and quick map storage without the risk of softlocking.</p>
    <p><strong>Myla's Revenge</strong> 💨🐈🌼 Die to Myla in steel soul mode. MMSing a GMMS save file into a steel soul file is both allowed and required for the route. Short category around the length of Myla%, which I will not recommend here
      because it is evil. It usually takes around 1min, not including loadless shenanigans.</p>
    <p><strong>Myla Flower</strong> 💨🐈🌼 Deliver the flower to Myla with the appropriate mod. Basically a Myla's revenge + Elderbug% combination category. </p>
    <p><strong>Dupeless 4 Mask Shards</strong> ☁🐈🍝 Collect 4 Mask Shards. GMMS noclip category, around 3-4 minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Dupeless 3 Vessel Fragments</strong> ☁🐈🍝 Collect 3 Vessel Fragments. GMMS noclip category. Slightly longer than 4MS</p>
    <p><strong>Markoth%</strong> ☁🐈🌼 Kill Markoth. Short GMMS noclip category, around 3min. </p>
    <p><strong>Nosk%</strong> ☁🐈🌼 Kill Nosk. Unfortunately, no one is allowed to bop me in this, because my time is exactly 3:00.00, which is both funny and extremely blessed. But it's still a good noclip category.</p>
    <p><strong>NKG%</strong> ☁🐈🍝 Kill Nightmare King Grimm. Fights NKG in noclip with invuln, so most of the risk comes from softlocking. Takes around 3-4min.</p>
    <p><strong>Gaslight, Gatekeep, Girlboss</strong> ☁🐈🌼 Light the Grimm lantern, open the City Crest gate, and talk to Emilitia. Silly category based on a meme. Spends most of the run in noclip and lasts around 4-5min. </p>
    <p><strong>Paleontology% </strong> ☁🐈🌼 Inspect all overworld journal entries. Noclip category that takes around 6min.</p>
    <p><strong>Marissa Audience</strong> ☁🐈🌼 Sit next to Marissa with the largest possible audience. GMMS noclip category, around 4-5min. Not very difficult, but it relies on geo RNG so it gets last place on this list.</p>
</div>
    <h2 id="medium-categories">Medium-Length Categories</h2>
    <div class="list">
    <p>These categories are generally in the 5-20min range. This is where non-GMMS noclip starts to be a thing, so there's a bit of a difficulty increase.</p>
    <p><strong>Dupeless TEAG</strong> ☁🐈⏱ Kill the Radiance. Has a large variety of glitches and spends a lot of the run in noclip. My second favorite category, after AGAG. Takes around 10min.</p>
    <p><strong>All Grubs All Glitches</strong> ☁🐈🍝 My personal favorite category. It's around 20min and is a ton of fun! You get to save all the grubs and it's a perfect run for someone who wants a noclip run that's more comparable to NMG meme runs
      in length. </p>
    <p><strong>All Whispering Roots</strong> ☁🐈🍝 Con's favorite category. Similar to AGAG in length and feel. </p>
    <p><strong>Path of Pain%</strong> ☁🐈🍝 Complete Path of Pain. Because GMMS doesn't start us with awoken dnail, this is the first category I'm recommending that does room dupes. Takes around 12min. </p>
    <p><strong>All Stag Stations</strong> ☁🐈🍝 Unlock all stag stations and ride the stag to stag nest. Spends basically the entire run in noclip. Very comfortable length at around 7min.</p>
    <p><strong>Zote%</strong> ☁🐈🍝 Defeat Zote in colo1. Short GMMS category that begins in noclip and ends with fury colo 1. If you like colo ILs, you might like this category. Takes around 7-8min.</p>
    <p><strong>GPZ%</strong> ☁🐈🍝 Defeat Grey Prince Zote. Basically Zote% but you do a few extra things. If you like colo ILs and GPZ you'll probably like this category, obviously. Takes around 10min.</p>
    <p><strong>Worldsoul%</strong> ☁🐈🌼 Collect every vessel fragment. GMMS noclip category that takes around 14min.</p>
    <p><strong>All Skulls</strong> ☁🐈🌼 No, it's not "All Skills". Collect every mask shard. Mostly is a GMMS noclip category but with a few twists (such as dgate flower quest) Takes around 20min.</p>
    <p><strong>Hiveblood%</strong> ☁★🍝 Obtain Hiveblood. A good introduction to non-GMMS noclip. Because we don't have wings, it's quite a bit more difficult. Takes around 10min.</p>
    <p><strong>Shriek%</strong> ☁★🌼 Obtain Abyss Shriek. Because there is a source requirement, we can't do GMMS, so we noclip to Basin, bench to lose noclip, and HOOB into abyss. Takes around 14min.</p>
    <p><strong>Lifeblood Core%</strong> ☁★🌼 Obtain Lifeblood Core. Similar to Shriek%, but shorter. Takes around 10min. </p>
    <p><strong>All Four Notch Charms</strong> ☁★ Obtain Joni's, Deep Focus, Hiveblood, and Soul Eater. Non-GMMS noclip category that takes around 16min.</p>
    <p><strong>Dupeless 8 Mask Shards</strong> ☁🐈🌼 Collect 8 Mask Shards. Spends the entire run in noclip. Takes around 7min.</p>
    <p><strong>5 Mimics</strong> ☁🐈🌼 Kill 5 mimics. If one fury colo wasn't enough, this is the category for you. Takes around 10min.</p>
    <p><strong>Scrappy Couple</strong> ☁🐈🌼 Release Bretta and Cloth into the wilderness. Great category if you like lesbians or fighting GPZ. Takes around 20min.</p>
    <p><strong>No Benches</strong> 💨🐈🌼 Complete the game without sitting on a bench. Basically a NG+ NMG category, with a couple of extra funnies (such as elevator storage). Good if you want a longer category but don't like noclip movement. Takes
      around 15min.</p>
    <p><strong>All Hallownest Seals</strong> ☁🐈🌼 Collect every Hallownest Seal. Pretty underrated noclip collectathon category, though it can't come close to competing with AGAG. Takes around 20min. </p>
      </div>
    <h2 id="long-categories">Long Categories</h2>
    <p>Okay, this might not be most people's definition of long, but it is mine. These categories are 20+min in length and do a lot of things! Most of these are inherently going to be less beginner-friendly than categories I've listed in the previous
      section.</p>
      <div class="list">
    <p><strong>All Dream Bosses TE</strong> ☁🐈🌼 Defeat all dream bosses including Radiance. Probably the most beginner-friendly category on this list. If you're new and like longer categories, this might be the one for you. Takes around 35min.</p>
    <p><strong>Kingsoul%</strong> ☁★🌼 Collect Kingsoul. Non-GMMS noclip category. Takes around 30min.</p>
    <p><strong>All Charm Notches</strong> ☁★🐈🍝 Collect all 8 charm notches. Starts out in a normal save file up until defeating Grimm, then does GMMS and does fury colo. Takes around 30min.</p>
    <p><strong>ACNKGPZ%</strong> ☁★🐈🌼 Collect all 8 charm notches, defeat NKG, and defeat GPZ. Similar to ACN but like, if ACN was a little longer. Takes around 45min.</p>
    <p><strong>All Great Knights</strong> ☁★🌼 Complete the quests for the 5 great knights in HK lore. Non-GMMS noclip category, so it's a bit risky. Takes around 30min.</p>
    <p><strong>AGKAGKAGK</strong> ☁★🌼 All great knights, all grimmkin, all glitches kingsoul. Probably the longest category I'll recommend here, and has a high potential of softlocking. Definitely not beginner-friendly. Takes around 50min.</p>
