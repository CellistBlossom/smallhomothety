    <p>Once upon a time, in a Hallownest after the Radiance’s fall, there lived a little grub named Gonzo.</p>
    <p>Gonzo used to live in a jar in the Tower of Love, but they didn’t feel loved at all.  After a cloak-wearing bug set Gonzo free, they went back to their friends and felt love again.  With the help of a charm and the Grubfather’s aid, they supported their hero in freeing Hallownest again.</p>
    <p>Gonzo was as grubby a grub as grubs did come: six little legs, two button eyes, and three grubby folds on their back.  It’s no wonder Gonzo tied for first (with all the other grubs) in the Grub Beauty Pageant each year.</p>
    <p>Gonzo was as grubby a grub as grubs did come, but lately, they’d hadn’t been feeling so grubby.  The Radiance was defeated, the infection gone.  But now that the bug hero’s quest was done, could Gonzo help anyone by singing their song? </p>
    <p>When grubbing gets tough, grubs find those they can trust.  The Grubfather, of course, was the trustiest friend of them all.  Gonzo waited for Grubfather to wake from his slumber.  After an hour, the grub woke without a grumble.  Excited that Gonzo had paid him a visit, Grubfather’s face fell when he saw Gonzo’s visage.</p>
    <p>“Gonzo, my child!  Why do you look so down?  A good grub like you seems so sad with that frown!”</p>
    <p>“Grubfather, lately, I’ve felt so lost.  Back in the day, we worked for the boss!  We helped save our home from that terrible moth!  But now our hero’s in the realm of the gods, fighting foes so radiant they can’t get hit once.  If the hero of the grubs can’t be healed by my song, then what do I do to keep grubbing along?”</p>
    <p>The Grubfather let out a big, sad sigh.  “Oh, little Gonzo, it’s clear you feel lost.  But everygrub knows you’re a treasure to us!  Hallownest is healing, and your voice can help.  With friendship and courage, you could even become a hero yourself… ”</p>
    <p>Gonzo meemeed and mawmawed in joy.  Seeing Gonzo’s excited disposition, the Grubfather decided to give them a mission.  “Go to Crystal Peak and find my old pal Mona.  They’re a bit of a grouch, but deep down they’re no loner.  They’ve left the grub lands because they don’t think they belong, but I believe you could bring them back with their song.”</p>
    <p>So Gonzo the Grub set out on their quest.  They’d never been to Crystal Peak before, so they started by taking a peek in the door.</p>
    <p>Gonzo had never seen so much light.  The place was so pink!  and rocky!  and bright!</p>
    <p>Squealing in shock, Gonzo spoke to himself: “This place is pink and spiky!  But grubs are green and squishy.  As much as I want Grubfather’s friend to come home, I’m not all too sure I can do this alone.”</p>
    <p>But when grubbing gets tough, grubs find those they can trust.  Gonzo went over to the False Knight’s old chamber.  They’d heard that there might be some more squishy friends there.  When Gonzo walked in, they found two maggots having a tea party.  The maggots, Marcus and Margaret, were happy to have company.</p>
    <p>“Hey grubby grub, what brings you here?”  The twin maggots chirped.</p>
    <p>Gonzo explained they’d been stopped in their quest.  If they couldn’t cross Crystal Peak, how could they save their friend?</p>
    <p>Marcus and Margaret knew just the cure.  Always up for adventure, the twins hopped in the False Knight’s suit.</p>
    <p>“We’ll take you with this!” Came an echoing shout.  All suited up, the three prepared to head out.</p>
    <p>Though there wasn’t much headroom, which hampered the climb, the party of friends made it to Mona just fine.  They went up through Dirtmouth to see Elderbug, making sure to say hi.  Then the three little bugs took the elevator for the first time.</p>
    <p>Looking down at the town, Gonzo grubbily gasped.  “I never knew that our world was so small.  But on this big knight’s back, I feel I can face it all.”</p>
    <p>Preparing their voice, Gonzo headed towards Mona’s home, allowing Marcus and Margaret to keep them safe from Peak’s dangerous stones.  As they hopped down into Mona’s hall, the twin maggots gave Gonzo a cheer:</p>
    <p>“Gonzo!  You’ve got this!  Together, we’re strong!  Now go on, and rescue Mona with your song!”</p>
    <p>When Gonzo found Mona, they were facing a wall.  Just as Grubfather said, they weren’t feeling so grubby, and they didn’t seem to want to tell Gonzo why.  </p>
    <p>Gonzo broke the silence with hope.  “Mona, I know that you’ve been alone, but I’m here to tell you that everygrub wants you home.”</p>
    <p>Mona turned around to show Gonzo their face.  At this point, Gonzo realized their reason for hiding away. When Mona stood up, Gonzo saw their long back legs and looked them in their tentacle eye.  Mona wasn’t feeling so grubby, and Gonzo could tell.  But Gonzo still knew that Mona was a friend.  So right then and there, Gonzo made up a song:</p>
    <p><em>Meemawmaw!  Mememememeeeee mawmee mawmawmawmeemawmaw!</em></p>
    <p>[Translation] “Mona, it doesn’t matter if your face is a claw or your legs are long.  To me, you’re a grub, and everygrub is a friend.  Come back and join us!  There are stories to tell.  Maybe you can sing a duet with me as well.”</p>
    <p>Mona, moved to tears by Gonzo’s song, morphed back into their grub form to give them a hug.  With the meeting complete and reunions to come, Mona greeted Gonzo with a hope they’d both thought gone:</p>
    <p>“Thank you, sweet Gonzo.  Let’s go home.”</p>
    <p>Together, Margaret, Marcus, Mona, and Gonzo journeyed back to the Grubfather’s home.  They each received a medal for their courage.  A tea party was held in Marcus and Margaret’s honour, and the two were named official Grubfriends for helping Gonzo.  Gonzo the Grub became a hero of all grubkind, eventually retiring from their quest after rescuing three more grub mimics.  In retirement, Gonzo worked as an opera singer for the rest of their long, grubby life.</p>
    <p>And everyone lived happily ever after.</p>
